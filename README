## General Information
I wrote this little program to check if my firewall in proxmox is reachable.
If it was not reachable, this program would restart the VM to fix the problem.
It would run as a cronjob every 5 minutes


## Usage
Variables to be set

| Varbailename  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ENV_TIMEOUT| Timeout of the request |
| ENV_URL | URL for the request|
| ENV_COMMAND | The command that should be used  |
| ENV_VMID  | ID of the VM the command should be used with  |
| ENV_COMMAND_PATH  | Path to the bin file, for example, /usr/sbin/qm  |
| ENV_WAITTIME | Wait time between the checks in seconds  |

Some of them have defaults; check the struct for more information


```shell
go run main.go 
```


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- make the time it is looped configurable
- make the command more flexible at the moment; it is quite a niche case (proxmox)
